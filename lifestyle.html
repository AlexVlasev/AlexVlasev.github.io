    <h2> Parkour </h2>
    <p>On one fateful day in June 2004 I stumbled upon a TV special about a group of young supermen from France performing feat of strength,
        speed and agility. Since I had very little sports background Parkour was ideal for me. I could go at my own pace and since
        the sport was relatively young I could do my own research into movement and skill. Thus began a 7 year journey that took me
        through intense training, self-discovery and conquering fears. I used to be very afraid of heights but I was no longer
        scared due to consistent exposure. However, recurring injury eventually made me fearful and I had to stop training in order to find something better for me.

    <h2> Ballroom Dancing </h2>
    <p>Ballroom dancing has been my passion since the beginning of 2011. With the exception of a few months break during
        one of my final semesters of undergrad I've been training consistently with my girlfriend and partner.
        We train hard and cultivate a champion mentality in ourselves. It has been more than just a hobby,
        taking us on journeys and competitions to USA and Europe. We move up steadily through the ranks and
        continuously increase our knowledge as well as physical fitness. Dancing has helped us take on the best shape of our lives.

        There are two styles - Standard and Latin. In Standard we take a close hold with our partner and start moving around the floor to music.
        The goal is to look tall, strong and happy while moving smoothly with speed and balance.
        In Latin we don't have a close hold so we dance more independently from each other.
        The goals are similar to Standard with a significant accentuation of the hip movement and without the big movement around the floor (for the most part).
