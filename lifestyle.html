  <h2> Parkour </h2>
  <p> When I started training in June 2004, Parkour was still a rather obscure sport featuring people performing what seemed like superhuman feats of speed, strength and agility. The next 7 years were one long journey to conquer my fears (for example, of heights). Ever since 2011 I have been training sporadically just for fun.
  <h2> Ballroom Dancing </h2>
  <p> Eventually my Parkour adventures transitioned into dancing in 2011. At first, it was just a hobby, but then it took over as a passion. Over the next 5 years I participated in nearly 50 competition across Canada, USA and Europe, winning some of them. <p>
  <h2>Photography</h2>
  <p> Ever since I bought my first smarthphone in 2013, I started taking snapping beautiful views. And it's so easy to find beautiful sights in Vancouver, because it's such a beautiful place. I particularly enjy taking photos of sunsets. Some of them will be available for sale as prints soon.</p>
