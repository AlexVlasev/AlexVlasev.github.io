<p> Welcome to my personal website. It's under construction (using Bootstrap). But please do take a look around and maybe tell me what you think.</p>

<h2>Software Projects</h2>
<p> I started self-learning software development in 2015 as I was nearing graduation This whole project is meant to showcase my software work. However, I don't have many demos yet. Just wait!</p>

<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<p> Studying mathematics or other STEM subjects has been a part of my family for generations. I grew up learning math. It's not surprising that I eventually took it up in university and pursued it as a career. I obtained a BSc from Simon Fraser University and then a MSc from the University of British Columbia. Here are 3 mathematical projects that I am most proud of.
<ul>
  <li><a ref="masters.html">Multidimensional Lattice Walk Enumeration (Master's thesis)</a></li>
  <li><a ref="operators.html">Linear Operators in the Theory of Electromagnetism (Undergraduate research project)</a></li>
  <li><a ref="scaling.html">Scaling of Physical Processes in People (Independent research)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Lifestyle Elements</h2>
<p> I have a constant need to move physically or I would feel stagnant. This works well to help me balance a more sedentary and thoughtful lifestyle of styding or working at a desk. It all started with Parkour in 2004. It was still a rather obscure sport featuring people performing what seemed like superhuman feats of speed, strength and agility. The next 7 years were one long journey to conquer my fears (for example, of heights). As I started Ballroom Dancing in 2011, the passion for Parkour moved towards dancing. Over the next 5 years I participated in nearly 50 competition across Canada, USA and Europe, winning some of them. Ever since I bought my first smarthphone in 2013, I started taking snapping beautiful views. And it's so easy to find beautiful sights in Vancouver, because it's such a beautiful place. I particularly enjoy taking photos of sunsets. Some of them will be available for sale as prints soon.</p>
