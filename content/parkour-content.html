<h1>Le Parkour (under construction)</h1>
<p>I started training Parkour in 2004 when I was just 14 years old. Mostly by myself at first, I learned a lot of different moves and started teaching friends how to do it. With time we all progressed and what started as a hobby became a passion. I trained seriously until 2011 and after that only occasionally for fun.</p>
<p>The sport comes with a great deal of focus training in order to become good and there is always a risk of injury, and in extreme cases, even death. You quickly learn to be fairly conservative with the kinds of moves and jumps you attempt. But even then, the risk is nonzero. A multitude of bails and injuries forced me to seek out less dangerous hobbies. Here are some photos and a video showcasing some of my achievements.</p>
