<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>My name is Alexandar Vlasev and this is my personal website. I have various experiences in life that I wish to collect in one place to show anyone who wishes to know about me. I find that my life feels the best when I engage it on multiple levels - both mental and physical. Check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexvlasev/">my LinkedIn page</a> for a professional view and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alex.vlasev">my Instagram page</a> for a view into my hobbies and lifestyle.</p>

<p>On the mental side of things, I studied Mathematics for about 8 years and obtained a BSc and an MSc in the subject. Later I made a career change and currently work my way through the different facets of software development. In the future, I envision myself in a leadership role either at an established company or at a company I create.</p>

<p>On the physical side of things, I trained Parkour from 2004 to 2011 and Ballroom Dancing from 2011 to 2016. I consider myself semi-professional at both, since I participated in many projects in film/commercials and participated in various shows. To support these activities, I keep in shape through diet and weight lifting.</p>

<p>I built the site myself, hosted it on GitHub pages and use Squarespace for the domain. Most of the site uses HTML with Bootstrap and runs some JavaScript scripts for visuals. The site is under construction, so this is not the final experience. Also, some aspects of it may not work yet. Feel free to check out the different pages.</p>
