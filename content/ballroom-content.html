<h1>Ballroom Dancing (under construction)</h1>
<p>At the end of my Parkour career, my girlfriend at the time introduced me to dancing. I don't remember what I was like before starting, but after I started, I found myself having to dance all the time. Either at home while cleaning or outside waiting for a bus. I had to dance! I danced competitively from 2011 until 2016 for about 6 years in the styles of International Standard and International Standard. I participated in nearly 50 competitions, winning medals in most of them. Here are some photos I'm fond of.</p>
